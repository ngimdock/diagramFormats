# FormatDate

Draw a reference frame to represent data formats in an orthogonal reference frame.

# First you need to clone the projet localy

```
git clone https://github.com/ngimdock/diagramFormats.git
```

# Generate the diagram

To generate the diagram, you only need to execute the program. Once the program has been executed, a new window will appear with the diagram drawn, so you can enlarge the window and download the diagram as an image (in png format).

# Run the project

```bash
python create_diagram.py
```

or

```bash
python3 create_diagram.py
```

# Generate the project without the text in the diagram

To generate the diagram without the text, you need to change the project branch to the n branch `without_text` and run the project again.

The project has 2 branches, one where there is text on the diagram(main) and the other where there is no text on the diagram(without_text)

# To change branch

```bash
get checkout without_text
```

```bash
get checkout main
```
